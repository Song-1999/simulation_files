Code accompanying "Scale-free spatio-temporal correlations in conformational fluctuations of intrinsically disordered proteins" by Haoyu Song and co-workers.

The manuscript investigated three intrinsically disordered proteins: FUS-C, LAF-N and TAF-C.

Ten independent simulations were performed for each protein, using Gromacs package.

The Folder with the name of corresponding protein includes the TPR files and PDB files (the initial conformation of the protein in a simulation) for all simulation trajectories.

The Folder "am99sb-disp.ff" includes the force field files for simulations.
